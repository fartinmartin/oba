# OneBusAway Scriptable Widget

Displays the next 3 arrivals of your route at the stop in your commute that you are nearest to.

User defines their commute as JSON in their iCloud drive (will eventually build a web based UI to build this JSON file).

## TODOs

- Monorepo
  - Web UI for options JSON
  - OBA script
- Abstract this repo as a more general Scriptable dev setup
- Additional widget sizes?

# OneBusAway Scriptable iOS Widget

Displays the next 3 arrivals of your route at the stop in your commute that you are nearest to.

User defines their commute as JSON in their iCloud drive (will eventually build a web based UI to build this JSON file).

## TODOs

- Monorepo, with additional package for options JSON web UI
- Additional double wide widget size (would show timing for next connection)
- Abstract this repo as a more general Scriptable dev setup

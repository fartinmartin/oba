# OneBusAway Scriptable Widget

Displays the next 3 arrivals of your route at the nearest stop in your commute.

User defines their commute as JSON in their iCloud drive (will eventually build a web based UI to build this JSON file).

## TODOs

- Improve the UI
  - Typography
  - Show last updated time
  - Additional widget sizes
    - Show progress of stops on bigger widgets?
- Monorepo
  - Web UI for options JSON
  - OBA script
- Abstract this repo as a more general Scriptable dev setup
